# Face-Recognition-using-MTCNN
Formally, Face Recognition is defined as the problem of identifying or verifying faces in an image. How exactly do we recognise a face in an image?

Face recognition can be divided into multiple steps. The image below shows an example of a face recognition pipeline.

Face detection — Detecting one or more faces in an image.
Feature extraction — Extracting the most important features from an image of the face.
Face classification — Classifying the face based on extracted features.

# MTCNN
MTCNN or Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks is a neural network which detects faces and facial landmarks on images. It was published in 2016 by Zhang et al.
MTCNN is one of the most popular and most accurate face detection tools today. It consists of 3 neural networks connected in a cascade.
