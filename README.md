# Face-Recognition-using-MTCNN
Deep learning advancements in recent years have enabled widespread use of face recognition technology. This article tries to explain deep learning models used for face recognition and introduces a simple framework for creating and using a custom face recognition system.  Formally, Face Recognition is defined as the problem of identifying or verifying faces in an image. How exactly do we recognise a face in an image?  Face recognition can be divided into multiple steps. The image below shows an example of a face recognition pipeline.   Face recognition pipeline. Face detection — Detecting one or more faces in an image. Feature extraction — Extracting the most important features from an image of the face. Face classification — Classifying the face based on extracted features.MTCNN MTCNN or Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks is a neural network which detects faces and facial landmarks on images. It was published in 2016 by Zhang et al.
